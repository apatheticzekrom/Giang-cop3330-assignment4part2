Using IntelliJ and Gradle, you will create a GUI-based desktop application to allow a user to manage multiple "todo"-type lists.

For [Part 1] of this assignment, you will focus on the design elements: UML Class Diagrams, GUI mock-ups, and pseudocode.

You will identify and define classes, interfaces, behaviors, and relationships; but, you will not implement any of the methods beyond what is required for a successful build.
Your `main()` method should only contain enough code to launch the application.
Your `start()` method should only contain enough code to load your FXML file and display it.
Any methods with a return value should simply return a literal.
Any methods without a return value should contain only pseudocode.

## How to use each method?
